<h1>About Me </h1> 

------

<div style='text-align: justify;'>I am Dharshan, I obtained my Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence & Data science from <a href="https://www.minds.iitb.ac.in/" style="text-decoration: none;">CMINDs</a> at <a href="https://www.iitb.ac.in/" style="text-decoration: none;">Indian Institute of  Technology, Bombay</a>. My research focuses on building resource-efficient neural architectures that can perform Image generation tasks like image inpainting. I have been associated with MeDAL (Medical Imaging, Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence Lab) and have worked under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~asethi/" style="text-decoration: none;">Prof. Amit Sethi</a>. I did my Bachelor's in Environmental engineering at <a href="https://www.iitk.ac.in/" style="text-decoration: none;">Indian Institute of  Technology, Bombay</a> as well. I was working in Aerosol and Air Quality Research Laboratory under the supervision of <a href="https://www.esed.iitb.ac.in/faculty/manoranjan-sahu" style="text-decoration: none;">Prof. Manoranjan Sahu</a>, where I developed a novel source apportionment algorithm based on particles size instead of chemical composition data.</div>  
<p>  </p>

<div style='text-align: justify;'>I have a keen interest in computer vision and have dabbled a bit in NLP as well. In addition to my scholastic research, i have pursued professional experiences through multiple internships in both AI as well as Environmental engineering. Some of the domains on which i have worked include: Image Inpaintig, Face-recognition, Image Generation, Diffusion models, GANs, Image Interpolation, 3D pose estimation and tracking, Environmental consulting, etc. Currently, i am looking to further my skills and knowledge by joining a reputable professional carrer.</div>

<br>I maintain a list of my publications under the Research tab and my full Resume is attached in the CV Tab.
